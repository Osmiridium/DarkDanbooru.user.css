# danbooru.user.css

This is my own personal userstyle for use on [Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us).
This style is intended for use with the Stylish Firefox extension.
This style also makes use of CSS variables which require Firefox 31+ and likely will not work with other browsers.

The style uses colors from chriskempson's excellent Base16 Eighties colour scheme, however thanks to variables can be easily modified to fit other colour schemes.

I also use some admittedly nonstandard fonts. The style calls for Proxima Nova for most text which is a non-free font, though I also list Montserrat as a fallback which is a more common font that can be obtained from Google fonts. Terminus is also used as a monospace font in a few instances. I also use KFHimaji for some Japanese text because I like the look of it. Naturally, the style will also fallback to whatever default sans-serif and monospace fonts are installed on the system.

The style also includes some styling for the Better Better Booru Userscript. Unfortunately, with changes and updates to the script this styling may break frequently.

The style looks like this:
